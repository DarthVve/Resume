# RESUME

This can be said to be my resume in form of a website. This site was intended to be a prototype, as it's successor is under development.
This version was built using HTML 5, CSS 3, and vanilla javascript. Even though I think it's overkill for a single page web app, the next version is being built with react/next and scss, and it will feature projects I have worked on and deployed so keep an eye out for 'PORTFOLIO'.
This version will still be maintained, as both instances will eventually be up and running.
