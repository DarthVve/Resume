#   PORTFOLIO 1
This can be said to be my resume in form of a website. This site is intended to be a prototype, as it's predecessor is under development.
This version was built using HTML 5, CSS 3, and vanilla javascript. Even though I think it's overkill for a single page web app, the next version is being built with react and scss, and it will feature projects I have worked on and deployed so keep an eye out for 'PORTFOLIO 2'.
This version will still be maintained, as both instances will eventually be up and running.
